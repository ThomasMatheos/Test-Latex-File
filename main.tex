Hello, LaTeX! I just tried enabling \LaTeX\ language support and LaTeX Previewer.

Now I am trying PingBang Hu's stuff. Fixed a comma.

I just installed the Conceal extension from Marketplace. Do Pingbang's settings work with it?
$\int f(x)$.

It looks good so far!

$\alpha$
Huge!
$\aleph$ need to add one for aleph. I will need to add many.

I got snip pets but I need to  figure out how to  ensure math mode. 

I deleted Pingbang's and copied the file the maker of Hypersnips V2 uses. $\bar{h}$ it works
hbar. $\bar{h}$

th $\gamma$ $\alpha$ $\varepsilon$ $\pi$  $\Xi$ Xi $\xi$ $\sigma \tau \Sigma$ $\varphi \Phi \phi$

$\aleph$

$\aleph$

$\varepsilon$

$\aleph_0$

$\aleph_0$

I think I have Greek letters and the four supported Hebrew letters working
